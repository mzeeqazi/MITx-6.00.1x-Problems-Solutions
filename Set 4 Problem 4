Hand Length
___________

We are now ready to begin writing the code that interacts with the player. We'll be implementing the playHand function. This function allows the user to play out a single hand. First, though, you'll need to implement the helper calculateHandlen function, which can be done in under five lines of code.

def calculateHandlen(hand):
    """ 
    Returns the length (number of letters) in the current hand.
    
    hand: dictionary (string int)
    returns: integer
    """
    
    # output initializaction    
    output = 0
    
    # sum all dictionary items values
    for values in hand.values():
        output += values
        
    return output
